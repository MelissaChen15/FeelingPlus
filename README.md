### FeelingPlus: A Design of Augmented Reality on Storybook as a Learning Tool for Young Learnersâ€™ Perspective-Taking and Implicit Story Comprehension

This project presents a novel system design of an augmented reality (AR) application called FeelingPlus which can be used as a learning tool for children to better understand the underlying meaning behind texts in a storybook. It aims to create a learning space for young learners by providing expressive audio effects and an interactive first-person view of story characters to facilitate perspective-taking with multi-language options, thus helping children with implicit story comprehension. The target age group for this project is children between 5 and 8. To achieve our goal, three features have been built into this application, including emotional and customized audio synthesis, interactive role-play, and multi-language access.
